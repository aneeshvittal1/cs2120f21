Introduction rule for not: show that P implies false for (P : Prop) (np : P â†’ false)

Introduction rule for false: None because false has no proof and 
if there was an intro rule, it would mean that false has a proof

Elimination rule for false: you can assume a proof of false

having no possible proof means that its fasle.

ex false quod libet -> false implies anything

TO prove an implication, first step is to assume a premise

have keyword pretty much says create a proof of whatever

classical.em gives you a proof of P or not P, axiom that states that if you have a proposition,
it must either be true or not true

predicate defines a property of something (kind of define a set in a way
since we can create a set all has this property)

predicates take arguments and return a proposition

you can use contradiction when you have a proof of p as well as a proof of not p

witness is what you use to prove something

Inference rules < theorem < 
and is commutative

introduction rule of P and Q requires a proof of P and a proof of Q
elim left is applied on a proof of P and Q, gives you a proof of P. same for right
